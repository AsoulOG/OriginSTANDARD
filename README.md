# OriginSTANDARD
OriginSTANDARD is a human-first authenticity engine. It enforces a hard boundary between creation and verification: a human must be present at origin for authenticity to exist. Deterministic, offline-verifiable, and zero-trust, it anchors digital provenance without interpretation or bias.
