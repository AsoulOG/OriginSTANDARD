ORIGIN STANDARD
Execution Authority at Layer 7.5
What This Is
OriginSTANDARD is not a fraud detection system.
It is not a behavioral scoring engine.
It is not post-hoc analytics.
OriginSTANDARD installs a deterministic execution boundary at Layer 7.5 — the point between application intent and irreversible state mutation.
If execution does not pass the boundary, it does not occur.
7.4 → 7.5 Architecture
Layer 7.4 — Mechanical Noise Reduction
7.4 removes low-effort automation before deterministic evaluation.
It is:
A load reducer
A cheap bot filter
A pre-boundary stabilizer
It is not authoritative.
Layer 7.5 — Deterministic Execution Boundary
7.5 is authoritative.
It sits at the last irreversible mutation primitive.
Execution requires:
Valid Seal artifact
Atomic nonce burn
PASS from frozen verifier
Conformance to immutable specification
No Seal → No execution.
There is no alternate commit path.
What Changes for an Enterprise
OriginSTANDARD does not modify:
Business rules
Application schema
Identity models
Downstream fraud tooling
User interface flows
It installs at the execution boundary.
Business continues unchanged.
Unauthorized execution ceases.
What It Competes With
OriginSTANDARD does not compete with:
One fraud tool
One bot mitigation vendor
One analytics provider
It competes with:
Execution-layer uncertainty
Bot-driven infrastructure waste
Post-execution fraud workflows
Multi-vendor defensive stacks
Legal and operational remediation overhead
It replaces post-hoc defense with pre-execution control.
Economic Model
Execution authority is licensed.
ACTIVE status is granted upon cleared joinder payment.
Tiered Authority Structure:
Tier
Revenue Threshold
Joinder Fee
Tier 1 — Enterprise
≥ $1B
$1,000,000,000
Tier 2 — Mid-Market
$500M–$999M
$500,000,000
Tier 3 — Regional
$250M–$499M
$250,000,000
Tier 4 — Super Small
< $250M
$100,000,000
In addition:
15% ongoing royalty on execution-derived value
Tier 1–3 entities receive Tier 4 referral rights (25% of Tier 4 Joinder Fee)
Authority is registry-controlled. Verification is public and permissionless. Issuance is restricted to ACTIVE entities only.
What This Is Not
OriginSTANDARD does not claim:
Fraud elimination guarantees
Behavioral infallibility
Risk scoring dominance
Post-hoc loss recovery
It enforces a simple invariant:
Unauthorized execution cannot occur.
Everything downstream benefits from that constraint.
Frozen Specification
All issuance and verification conform to the immutable Engine Specification:
Engine Series: QuadSentinel
Engine Spec Version: v1.3.4r5
Spec Commit: fef1134903a5afdbf019de46b4b07a0b8f481ed8
Spec SHA-256: 1ae67f2fdbe9666675867f6d5f1c74ebe333792d6d00263e94f15952bcdf6e28
License: OSL-1.0
The specification does not update. It does not drift. It does not reinterpret.
No updates. Only forks.
Core Invariant
If a mutation occurs, it passed the boundary.
If it did not pass the boundary, it did not occur.
The verifier outputs only:
PASS
FAIL
INVALID
No interpretation. No discretionary override. No advisory scoring.
Deterministic.
Strategic Position
OriginSTANDARD restores execution control at the boundary.
It does not chase fraud. It prevents unauthorized execution.
It does not analyze aftermath. It eliminates the cause.
One-Line Definition
OriginSTANDARD is deterministic execution authority at Layer 7.5.- Verification is public.
- Issuance authority is restricted to **ACTIVE** entities only.
- Unstamped artifacts have no verification state.

Joined entities may issue and verify.  
Non-joined entities may verify only.

---

### Enforcement

There are:
- No tiers.
- No exceptions.
- No negotiated variance.

Joinder occurs only by payment.  
Non-payment results in no joinder.
