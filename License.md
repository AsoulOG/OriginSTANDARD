1. Definitions

“Engine”
The OriginSTANDARD Engine, including but not limited to the Glow + Seal mechanism,
invariant rules, refusal surface, signing logic, and issuance workflow.

“Verifier”
Any software that validates OriginSTANDARD outputs strictly according to the
published OriginSTANDARD specification, without modification, extension,
or interpretation.

“Standard Output”
Any artifact (including but not limited to media, documents, or data) that
contains a valid OriginSTANDARD Glow + Seal and passes verification using
a conforming Verifier.

“You” / “Licensee”
Any individual or entity using, integrating, distributing, or interacting
with software, specifications, or outputs covered by this license.

------------------------------------------------------------

All right, title, and interest in the OriginSTANDARD Engine, including signing

- Issuing “compatible,” “alternative,” or “equivalent” Glow or Seal formats
- Modifying invariant rules while claiming OriginSTANDARD compliance
- Using the specification to construct a competing issuance or authenticity system
- Representing unsigned, self-signed, or third-party-signed artifacts as

  mechanisms

4.5 Unauthorized Representation Prohibited

Any system, software, service, or process that produces outputs intended to be
represented, marketed, implied, or interpreted as OriginSTANDARD Standard Output
without authorization from Origin Standard LLC is expressly prohibited,
regardless of functional similarity, behavioral equivalence, or specification
conformance.

Violation voids any granted rights immediately.

------------------------------------------------------------

5. Non-Adaptation Clause

The OriginSTANDARD specification is frozen by design.

Licensees may not:
- Extend
- Adapt
- Reinterpret
- “Improve”
- Soft-fork

the Engine semantics while retaining the OriginSTANDARD name, branding,
or implied claim.

Compatibility means exact conformance, not intent, similarity, or outcome.

------------------------------------------------------------

6. Signature Authority

Only cryptographic keys issued by Origin Standard LLC constitute valid
OriginSTANDARD signing authority.

Possession of a Verifier does not grant issuance rights.
Possession of the specification does not grant issuance rights.
Possession of the code does not grant issuance rights.

No exception.

------------------------------------------------------------

7. No Warranty

The software, specification, and verification process are provided “as is”.

Origin Standard LLC disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but
not limited to merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

Verification does not assert truth, value, legality, ownership, or authorship.
Verification asserts conformance only.

------------------------------------------------------------

8. Termination

Any breach of this license immediately terminates all rights granted herein.

Termination does not affect:
- Previously verified Standard Outputs
- Public rights to verify existing outputs

------------------------------------------------------------

9. Governing Principle

Verification is public.
Issuance is sovereign.
Truth is not negotiable.
